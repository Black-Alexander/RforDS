## Reducing code duplication has 3 main benefits
# 1. It's easier to see the intent of the code
# 2. It's easier to response to changes in requirements. It's easier to make changes in one place than several.
# 3. You're likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places.

## Tools to Reduce
# One tool for reducing duplication is functions, which reduce duplication by identifying same patterns.
# Another tool to reduce duplication is iteration.

## This chapter will teach you about two important iteration paradigms:
# 1. Imperative Programming
  # Tools like for loops and while loops
# 2. Functional Programming
  # Tools to extract out this duplicated code, so for each common for loop pattern gets its own function

#**************
## Master vocabulary for FP, you can solve many common iteration problems with less code, more ease, and fewer errors.
